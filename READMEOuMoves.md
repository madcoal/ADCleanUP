PowerShell Scripts
One script is used to move Objects in AD with a server operating system from one OU to another, the other is for "non" Server OS objects
(Think desktops/laptops. This works great to clean up your Active directory enviroment when desktops/laptops are joined to the domain or
when servers are created. Just set Task Scheduler to ran the script every night and automate the whole process.
